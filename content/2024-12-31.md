This post was written on last sunday, As always I did nothing today but plan. I did one thing I went out to see the world. All alone by myself. And as always my people were surprised where I am headed to as someone who got no friends and no reasons to go out. But I did, I went out. I have been travelling in metro all my life still got confused navigating it once again. I am really underconfident. I stopped at the Delhi Gate realized it sounds like delicate but ok. I walked a few steps. 20 precisely including a jump I am short so anything longer than a standard step I need to jump And asked for a badi advance, again the shopkeeper pretended not to give the change back. This part of the story is being written today. Whatever is left in my memory of that day is being shared. Also, I will be using realized from now onwards, and I have noticed that I am using that word quite often. But the goal is to share and write better which will happen with time. I pointed towards the Happydent chewing gum, and he gave me one. For the last few days it has been raining, but today it did not. I got encountered by one of those fake lost people who ask you for money, so i muttered a little and walked away from there and crossed the road in order to reach the book market. The cigarette smell had covered me I reached an egg hawker and asked for boiled eggs he said it will take time so i proceeded to the market and started exploring from the last shop of the market.
My parents think that I am living with them because I love them but it was just an act of self destruction that I played by not taking them for granted and giving them importance while denying other opportunities that exist in this world, I started going to college on a regular basis this semester, I was waking up on time in the morning I was feeling ok about doing so, but I didn't did anything else as it helped me not to participate in this world and helped me delay my work even more. At that time my mind was being a little destructive without me knowing. 2 months ago the RSS people visited me. Their sole concern was me, they kept giving me hints and at the end they just said it "`aakhri tak jaana hai hn abhi jeevan ko pura jeena hai yeh samajh lo`" he said it to me quite a few times. It was as if I did appear depressed to the outside world too.
Saw this post on twitter and yes we should track ourselves more often it really helps me a lot. Just by tracking things here and there I can look back at them and at least understand where did I wasted my time and how I can waste even more now.

Tracking gives me a sense that the time I tracked doing be it watching movie or anything it does not have to be productive is not wasted. As the year is coming to an end this year itself I watched around 58 movies including 1 more I am watching as I am writing this post.

Saw the Unfinished a Memoir lying on my side in bed, in the cover of it there's Priyanka Chopra posing as intentionally showing her tattoo "daddy's lil girl" what I realized that not all of us are capable of committing that much to have a tattoo. Nowadays such a tattoo would be considered cringe by the most people on internet, but sometime back it was cool, It's still cool, but the consensus may not agree on that. A tattoo is one of the example of keeping track of time. Speaking for myself I cannot have such a large commitment of having something such as tattoo on my body, but I could still use something like Goodreads and Letterboxd to track my time. Soon I will be making vlogs too and have decided to take more photos as I go through life. Also,this post gives me a reminder to be positive and stop caring what others think as they always got something to say. They hate you. And you should not hate yourself.

Yesterday I installed 7 dating apps(Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Happn, Boo, Schmooze, Aisle) and made a profile with just one picture of mine in which I am seen squinting my eyes, and it's not really uploaded in sense to appeal anyone of any sort. I am trying these apps I would say. I will be keeping them for the whole year with me and see how it turns out. Will keep y'all updated on it. As of right now for the first time of going through them, I tried being picky and disliked some people on there, but now I am liking whoever comes up. And let's do it for all, why not? I mean with the photo that I have put up nobody would like me but what if someone did. How matched shit would that be. BTW last times I installed these apps I would get around 2â€“3 matches. Now it seems like I am going to get none. But stay tuned. 
I got irritated again when my father asked me to check where the file he just downloaded is located in his smartphone. I just woke up I haven't splashed water in my face and did not take a dump. As always I felt bad after 5 minutes of saying it I started relating myself to the "Voltaire's good brahmin" character in which he told the author that he would rather live this unpleasant life in search of truth rather than being stupid and happy. But soon I realized that am the later, as half of my day's mood depends upon whether I took a proper shit or not.
With the new year coming my urge to leave everything behind and start a new life in a new place has become even more. But I can't as I still have this college to complete. The day I get my degree in hand I will just disappear from here. But will be leaving some sort of money behind for my parents. I have been a degenerate for a while, without realizing it and need to fix that. In 2025, I will try my best to make money and be as social as possible. 
Right now I am sitting in my room with all the lights off when out there the day is up and about to masturbate on New Year's Eve. I did had an anxiety attack like half an hour ago I may still be having it but who cares. I keep thinking about documenting as I don't know if I will make it till the end or even if do I would have anything to show for.
