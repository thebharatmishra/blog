As always I did nothing today but plan. I did one thing I went out to see the world. All alone by myself. And as always my people were surprised where I am headed to as someone who got no friends and no reasons to go out. But I did I went out. I have been travelling in metro all my life still got confused navigating it once again. I am really underconfident. I stopped at the Delhi gate realised it sounds like delicate but ok. I walked a few steps. 20 precisely including a jump I am short so anything longer then a standard step I need gotta jump And asked for a badi advance again the shopkeeper pretended not to give the change back.
