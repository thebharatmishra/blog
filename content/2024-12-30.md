When I go from reading a book then solving math to then doing my cybersecurity stuff I am quite enjoying it and others do appreciate me for it. But working on myself makes me feel like I am betraying people or some people in particular. My advice for you is that stop thinking about these people. I am just doing what I like I never did to achieve something I know it may have a positive impact on my life but still I like doing it. Stop stressing. These people are betraying themselves they are no good. If anyone gives you off these vibes, try to disconnect from them and be aware around them share less with these people. Take control.
"It's not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you". It applies to everything be it saying, acting and sometimes even your thoughts. I may document things that I feel like writing. Some really good moments which I may not document but when shared they may make me look like something better or bigger person than I actually am or maybe opposite. I really do or do not give a shit I don't even know. But you would only get to know what I share, so it would most probably be what defines me in front of you. What's underneath me is still unknown to me. These notes are also to myself as much as are they to you my friend. The quote from batman has even a deeper meaning I may not understand it now but we many get back to it in the future. 
Just saw the news it looks like people born after 1 Jan 2025 will be labelled as Generation BETA. And So my grandfather was 93 in 2011 when he died and my father was born in 1969. Which makes my grandfather a Builders(1925-1945) and Father from GEN X(1965-1979). There's literally a whole BOOMER generation missing from in between. Realistically, If you are from let say GEN Z you should have kids by the next GEN or GEN BETA. I don't know why I thought that and wrote this whatever man this shit is just my time pass. Also, if you are someone from GEN Y and educated enough to read this please have kids it's request from a fellow friend. Moreover, my dad is like my grandfather's `budhaape ki santaan`. 
LOL just realised that's the same case with me and my dad I was born in 2004. 
Time is flying really fast, and I am not able to realise it that's most probably I am writing this. And you may notice me writing time is flying in my later posts too.
Imagined myself on a stage in an interview late night show podcast like setting, for the reference joker movie but i am just there giving people advice and I started talking from thinking about how i save money while travelling in Haryana roadways to then how much I love my parents and that's also the reason I hate them its like the love hate thing I need to try to do some work. Thinking about Voltaire, not thinking about Voltaire. I am still not able to remember much of the thought I had and also I am not that frequent to writing but then again its like I am just getting started.
Just look at this image I feel like it may help y'all in learning.

Just realised that I can also look at this image again and again for the reference as I am going to post this stuff on my website. Also this autocorrector keeps telling me that i should use z in realised but i realise that I want to write it as realised.
Yes I want to be heard and fuck you person in my brain fuck you.
My father sent me to RSS in 2016 so that he can progress himself among the BJP people and become a politician it was a decision he made for himself and not me but eventually I met good people there. Fascists or not they were also humans at the end and as I am living in an urban area they are civilised. But the thing is that I feel like now it could have benefitted me a lot only if my mind would have been in the right place and I wouldn't have tried to cut ties with them 4 years ago. As I mentioned they are at the end just humans and good enough to stay connected I still meet them sometimes in the `shakha` itself. I feel like I need to get in there and start participating more in their events. I will keep you all updated as it might make a huge turn in my life, but I would not stop writing these. There's a lot that I need to write I will be writing them as I remember them It could happen anytime, whenever possible. 
Opened Instagram and the third posts on Screen was Lund's University by the internet sensation "`subject` is brand of smart people" guy. Yes I giggled, I always do.
